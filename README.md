```


## Deployment

It will default to port 80, you can change the port in [main.py](https://github.com/char2int/yt-dlp-web/blob/main/main.py).
## Why would I make this
I made this python script to learn more about python and flask. This is my first flask script and I am quite happy with it. I plan on pushing some code refactoring and optimizations as I make them!
## Check out the Blog!

I will make a post about this project and when I do it will be linked here!
